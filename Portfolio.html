        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Shantoria Taylor. </p>
        <p> More things about me. I'm from Tennessee. I went to university in California. I worked for two years in China before returning to the United States.</p>
        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
        <p> I do not have a background in coding. Rather, my background is in humanitiess and the education field.</p>
        <p>One of my proudest accomplishements was creating a non-partisan group on campus and doing community outreach with them. Though working with limited resources and a small school base, we were able to successfully organize and run a drive for the homeless in our community. We were able to donate more than a thousand hygiene pieces. This, coming from a university of approx. 400 students.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p> I, personally, love learning different languages. Over the years, I've put a lot of effort in trying to learn the basics of a number of languages.</p>
        <p> I also enjoy discovering new tv shows to watch. Though, I haven't been able to watch many recently. </p>
